    <h1>History of Table Tennis</h1>

    <div class="history-right">The game of Table Tennis began in England around the late 1800s as a lawn tennis spinoff. The difference between the two was that the newer sport was for the middle class, and was played in parlors rather than on lawns. Champagne corks were used as balls, cigar boxes as bats and books for a net. But after it became recognized as a game by David Foster in 1897, several developments were made. Notably, in 1901, James Gibb created the first Celluloid balls, and a year later, E.C. Gould introduced rackets covered in rubber.</div>
