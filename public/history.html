    <h1>History of Table Tennis</h1>

    <div class="history-origins"><h2>Origins</h2><br>The game of Table Tennis began in England around the late 1800s as a lawn tennis spinoff. The difference between the two was that the newer sport was for the middle class, and was played in parlors rather than on lawns. Champagne corks were used as balls, cigar boxes as bats and books for a net. But after David Foster created the first game of tennis on a table in 1897, several developments were made. Notably, in 1901, James Gibb created the first Celluloid balls, and a year later, E.C. Gould introduced rackets covered in rubber. <br><br>Table Tennis continued to grow, and eventually the Ping Pong Association, along with its rival Table Tennis Association, was created. It was around this time that Table Tennis reached Asia, who now dominate the sport. <br><br>Interest in the sport then dropped significantly, with only a few outlets remaining in Europe. Then, in 1922, Table Tennis returned to England, however the rules differed between groups. This led to rules being established, and the subsequent creation of the International Table Tennis Federation in Berlin, Germany. The same year, the first official World Championships were held. <br><br>Table Tennis was then adopted by the Olympics in 1988, and has since become a globally recognized sport.</div>
